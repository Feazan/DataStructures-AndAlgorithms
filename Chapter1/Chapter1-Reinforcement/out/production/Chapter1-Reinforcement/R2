Suppose that we create an array A of GameEntry objects, which has an integer
scores field, and we clone A and store the result in an array B. If we then immediately
set A[4].score equal to 550, what is the score value of the GameEntry
object referenced by B[4]?

Answer: B[4] will equal 550. Cloning A to B, B will reference the same array as A.
Thus making the change A[4] = 550 will cause B[4] to reflect the change.
